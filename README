OpenDRDA is an implementation of the DRDA protocol.  DRDA was developed by IBM 
as a distributed (two phase commit) protocol for heterogeneous environments.
It seems to have gotten the most use in MVS and AS/400 environments, but 
interestingly enough seems to be supported natively by DB2 UDB on Unix, OS/2, 
and NT platforms as well. That is what I am using to test against.

Building
--------

First off I wouldn't bother unless you have very limited requirements for this or are interested in helping with the project, it doesn't do much right now.

To build:

./configure
make

and run the 'server_info' program specifying the host and port of your DRDA enabled server.  If you have an AS/400 or mainframe laying around I'd be interested to know whether the code works against it.

You'll need unixODBC 2.0.x for the ODBC stuff to work, 2.1.0 and above are broken for reasons related to a SQLGetFunctions() change that I still need to look into.

To enable some verbose output modify the Makefile to include -D DRDALOG in the compile and you'll get send/receive packets plus call traces.

The 'createpkg' program creates a default package in DB2 for OpenDRDA to use.
It must be run using an account with BIND ADD permissions, before some of the
other programs (tester or unixODBC's isql) will work.

The tester program will attempt to issue a simple select query against the DB2
'sample' database.

To set up an odbc.ini entry use something like the following:

[sample]
Driver = /home/bdog/src/opendrda/src/odbc/.libs/libdrdaodbc.so
Description = DB2 Sample Database
URL = drda://db2inst2.mypassword@localhost:3506/sample

See the docs/URL document for details on the URL line
